The solution is straightforward: Use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality, preventing the unexpected results seen with loose comparison. 

```php
<?php
$stringZero = '0';
$booleanFalse = false;

if ($stringZero === $booleanFalse) {
  echo "These are equal (shouldn't happen)!";
} else {
  echo "These are NOT equal (correct behavior)!";
}
?>
```
By employing strict comparison, we ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the difference in type and value between a string '0' and a boolean `false`, preventing unexpected behavior.
